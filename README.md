# Debt-Collection-System
### Project Description: Debt Collection System

#### Overview

The Debt Collection System is a comprehensive application designed to manage and streamline the process of debt collection. It provides functionalities for user authentication, customer management, debt tracking, communication, and reporting. The system is built using the NestJS framework, which offers a modular architecture, making it scalable and maintainable.

#### Modules

1. **Auth Module**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
   - **Components**:
     - `AuthController`: Manages authentication-related endpoints such as registration, login, and token refresh.
     - `AuthService`: Contains business logic for user authentication.
     - `JwtStrategy`: Implements JWT-based authentication strategy.
     - `User` Entity: Represents the user in the database.

2. **Customer Module**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages customer information.
   - **Components**:
     - `CustomerController`: Manages endpoints related to customer operations.
     - `CustomerService`: Contains business logic for managing customers.
     - `Customer` Entity: Represents the customer in the database.

3. **Debt Module**:
   - **Purpose**: Tracks and manages debts.
   - **Components**:
     - `DebtController`: Manages endpoints related to debt operations.
     - `DebtService`: Contains business logic for managing debts.
     - `Debt` Entity: Represents the debt in the database.

4. **Communication Module**:
   - **Purpose**: Handles communication with customers.
   - **Components**:
     - `CommunicationController`: Manages endpoints related to communication operations.
     - `CommunicationService`: Contains business logic for managing communications.
     - `Communication` Entity: Represents the communication in the database.

5. **Reporting Module**:
   - **Purpose**: Generates reports related to debt collection.
   - **Components**:
     - `ReportingController`: Manages endpoints related to reporting operations.
     - `ReportingService`: Contains business logic for generating reports.
     - `Report` Entity: Represents the report in the database.

6. **Database Module**:
   - **Purpose**: Manages database connections and configurations.
   - **Components**:
     - `DatabaseService`: Contains logic for database connection and configuration.

#### Main Components

1. **App Module**:
   - The root module of the application that imports all other modules.
   - **Components**:
     - 

AppController

: Manages the root endpoint of the application.
     - 

AppService

: Contains business logic for the root endpoint.

2. **Entities**:
   - Represent the data models used in the application.
   - Examples include `User`, `Customer`, `Debt`, `Communication`, and `Report`.

#### Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT Authentication**: The system uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure authentication. The `JwtStrategy` is implemented to validate tokens and protect routes.
- **Guards**: `AuthGuard` is used to protect routes that require authentication.

#### Example Endpoints

- **Auth Module**:
  - `POST /auth/register`: Registers a new user.
  - `POST /auth/login`: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.
  - `POST /auth/refresh`: Refreshes the JWT token.
  - `GET /auth/users`: Retrieves a list of users (protected route).

- **Customer Module**:
  - `GET /customers`: Retrieves a list of customers.
  - `POST /customers`: Creates a new customer.
  - `PUT /customers/:id`: Updates a customer's information.
  - `DELETE /customers/:id`: Deletes a customer.

- **Debt Module**:
  - `GET /debts`: Retrieves a list of debts.
  - `POST /debts`: Creates a new debt.
  - `PUT /debts/:id`: Updates a debt's information.
  - `DELETE /debts/:id`: Deletes a debt.

- **Communication Module**:
  - `GET /communications`: Retrieves a list of communications.
  - `POST /communications`: Creates a new communication.
  - `PUT /communications/:id`: Updates a communication's information.
  - `DELETE /communications/:id`: Deletes a communication.

- **Reporting Module**:
  - `GET /reports`: Retrieves a list of reports.
  - `POST /reports`: Generates a new report.

#### Technologies Used

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.
- **TypeORM**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) for TypeScript and JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5).
- **Passport**: Middleware for authentication in Node.js.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Token for secure authentication.

#### Conclusion

The Debt Collection System is a robust application designed to manage the entire debt collection process efficiently. Its modular architecture ensures scalability and maintainability, making it suitable for both small and large-scale implementations. The use of modern technologies like NestJS, TypeORM, and JWT ensures that the system is secure, reliable, and performant.
